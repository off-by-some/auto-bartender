  # HOW TO CALCULATE THE REFFERENCE UNIT
  # Set this reference unit to 1. Put 1kg on your sensor or anything you have and know exactly how much it weights.
  # In this case, 92 is 1 gram because, with 1 as a reference unit I got numbers near 0 without any weight
  # and I got numbers around 184000 when I added 2kg. So, according to the rule of thirds:
  # If 2000 grams is 184000 then 1000 grams is 184000 / 2000 = 92.
  REFERENCE_UNIT = 414

  # I've found out that, for some reason, the order of the bytes is not always the same between versions of python, numpy and the hx711 itself.
  # Still need to figure out why does it change.
  # If you're experiencing super random values, change these values to MSB or LSB until to get more stable values.
  # There is some code below to debug and log the order of the bits and the bytes.
  # The first parameter is the order in which the bytes are used to build the "long" value.
  # The second paramter is the order of the bits inside each byte.
  # According to the HX711 Datasheet, the second parameter is MSB so you shouldn't need to modify it.
